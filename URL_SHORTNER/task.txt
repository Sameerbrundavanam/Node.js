Design a URL Shortner that takes in a Valid URL and returns a shortened URL, redirecting the user to 
the previously provided URL.

Also, keep track of the total visits/clicks on the URL.

Routes:

POST:
    /URL -> Gnerates a new short URl and returns the shortened URL in the format of example.com/random-id.

GET:
    /:id -> Redirects the user to the original URL.

GET
    /URL/analytics/:id -> Retuns the clicks/visits for the provided short URL id.
